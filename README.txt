	Site guide:

	Our site is designed to classify the most common mushrooms in Kazakhstan forests. 
	Among them, almost all mushrooms are harmless; however, it is important to always 
	check whether a particular mushroom can be eaten or not. On our website you can upload 
	your photo of the mushroom you found and understand what kind of mushroom it is. In 
	the initial part of the site you can familiarize yourself with information about each 
	of these mushrooms.
